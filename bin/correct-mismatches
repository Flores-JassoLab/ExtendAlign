# blastn does not align the complete sequence
# and calculates the mismatch between it's aligned region and the reference.
#
# As we are interested in knowing the real mismatch number between the whole sequence
# and the reference we need to extend the alignment and calculate the real mismatch.
#
# The `extend_alignment` is declared at `bin`
# and it's output format is described in
@include "ea_format"
#
# And the logic to count at
@include "ea_count_mismatches"
#
# In order to obtain the correct mismatch
# the extended alignment script adds columns
# containing the sequence that were added to the alignment
# in both the query and the subject:
#
#   - query_5_seq
#   - subj_5_seq
#
#   - query_3_seq
#   - subj_3_seq
#
# Each queryâ€“subject pair should match on length.
#
#
# This script fixes counts unaligned regions as mismatches
# --------------------------------------------------------
#
# Short query sequences may align to the edges of the subject_sequences
# and thus we need to consider the unaligned regions as mismatches
