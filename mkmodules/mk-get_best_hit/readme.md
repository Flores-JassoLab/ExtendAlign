## Module Description:
Extract the best hit for every query in a ExtendAlign `HSe-blastn` results file.  

1. An ExtendAlign `HSe-blastn` results file may have many hits per query, sometimes you only want to find the best hit.
2. The best hit definition for ExtendAlign is query focused: the `HSe-blastn` alignment with the longest alignment length 
but the lowest number of query mismatches (this means that gaps introduced in the subject sequence are counted as query mismatches).  
3. This module uses a simple strategy to finde best hits:  

  3.1. sort by alignment length, and query mismatches, accordingly;  
  3.2. then print a line each time a query ID appears for the first time in the sorted results.  

4. In practice, we have one `HSe-blastn` result per query; this line reports the the longest alignment with the least number of mismatches from a query point of view.

### Input:
A custom `HSe-blastn` output TAB separated file, with `.EAblastn.tsv` extension.  

Example line(s):
```
qlength qseqid slength sseqid pident length mismatch gaps qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore sstrand qseq sseq qngap sngap query_mismatch subject_mismatch
26 hsa-miR-12128.MIMAT0049022 107 mmu-mir-767.MI0012530 82.353 17 3 0 8 24 73 89 0.97 18.9 plus ATGGCGCATGAAGAGGA ATGGTTCCTGAAGAGGA 0 0 3 3
26 hsa-miR-12128.MIMAT0049022 75 mmu-mir-343.MI0005494 88.235 17 1 1 10 26 61 46 2.8 17.3 minus GGCGCATGAAGAGGAGA GGCACATGAAG-GGAGA 1 0 2 1
26 hsa-miR-12128.MIMAT0049022 95 mmu-mir-221.MI0000709 82.353 17 3 0 3 19 4 20 0.97 18.9 plus CAGGGATGGCGCATGAA CAGGTCTGGGGCATGAA 0 0 3 3
```

**Note(s):**
* For this example, some TABs were replaced by white spaces.  
* Three-`HSe-blastn` hits for the same query ID (hsa-miR-12128.MIMAT0049022) are shown.

### Output:
A custom `HSe-blastn` output TAB separated file, with `.EAblastnbesthit.tsv` extension.  
This **best hit** file contains one hit per query ID.  

Example line(s):
```
qlength qseqid slength sseqid pident length mismatch gaps qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore sstrand qseq sseq qngap sngap query_mismatch subject_mismatch
26 hsa-miR-12128.MIMAT0049022 75 mmu-mir-343.MI0005494 88.235 17 1 1 10 26 61 46 2.8 17.3 minus GGCGCATGAAGAGGAGA GGCACATGAAG-GGAGA 1 0 2 1
```

**Note(s):**

* Only one **best hit** was kept, since it has an alignment length of 17, and 2 query mismatches.  
* Closest hit had an alignment length of 17, and 3 query mismatches, thus it was filtered out.  

For Output File Column Descriptions: see readme.md in module `mk-HSe-blastn`; columns remain the same.
