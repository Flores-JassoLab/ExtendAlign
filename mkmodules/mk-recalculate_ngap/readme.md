## Module description:
Add number of mismatched nucleotides due to gaps introduced to query and subject sequences, respectively.  

1. This module calculates the number of `-` characters in the `HSe-blastn` query sequence used for alignment.  
2. It also calculates the number of `-` characters in the `HSe-blastn` subject sequence used for alignment.  
3. These values are used to cross define the number of mismatched nucleotides at query and subject sequences.

## Module Dependencies:
NONE

### Input:
A custom `HSe-blastn` output TAB separated file, with `.blastn.tsv` extension.  

Example line(s):
```
qlength qseqid slength sseqid pident length mismatch gaps qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore sstrand qseq sseq
26 hsa-miR-12128.MIMAT0049022 68 mmu-mir-6926.MI0022773 87.500 16 1 1 4 19 17 31 8.2 15.8 plus AGGGATGGCGCATGAA AGGGATGGTG-ATGAA
```

**Note(s):**
* For this example, TABs were replaced by white spaces.  
* This format is produced by the `mk-HSe-blastn` mkmodule.

### Output:
A custom `HSe-blastn` output TAB separated file, with `.EAcoordinates.tsv` extension.  
This coordinates file contains extra columns for the common `HSe-blastn` format.  

Example line(s):
```
qlength qseqid slength sseqid pident length mismatch gaps qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore sstrand qseq sseq qmismatch_in_gap smismatch_in_gap query_mismatch subject_mismatch
26 hsa-miR-12128.MIMAT0049022 68 mmu-mir-6926.MI0022773 87.500 16 1 1 4 19 17 31 8.2 15.8 plus AGGGATGGCGCATGAA AGGGATGGTG-ATGAA 1 0 2 1
```

**Note(s):**  
* For this example, TABs were replaced by white spaces.  
* DO note the fact that a gap `-` introduced at the subject sequence is counted as 1 `qmismatch_in_gap`. 
In case the gap would span 2 nt `--`, the number of mismatches in gaps (`qmismatch_in_gap`) would be reported as 2.  
* Finally, the `query_mismatch` is 2 due to the original 1 mismtach reported by blastn + the `qmismatch_in_gap` calculated by ExtendAlign.  

Output File Column Descriptions: see readme.txt in module `mk-HSe-blastn` for basic column description; 
new columns are described as follows:  

`qmismatch_in_gap`: Number of nucleotides in query skipped by the gapped regions of a `HSe-blastn` alginment. For ExtendAlignment downstream analysis, we consider this as mismatches specifically from the query point of view.  
`smismatch_in_gap`: Number of nucleotides in subject skipped by the gapped regions of a `HSe-blastn` alginment.  
`query_mismatch`: Total number of `HSe-blastn` mismatches for query after taking into account the gap configuration in each alignment.  
`subject_mismatch`: Total number of `HSe-blastn` mismatches for subject after taking into account the gap configuration in each alignment.
